JLEYSYRKK	ČT24, Česká televize	Tomáš Karlík	NA	NASA odkládá start misí Artemis k Měsíci, soukromí dodavatelé nestíhají — ČT24 — Česká televize	Americký Národní úřad pro letectví a vesmír (NASA) o rok odložil mise Artemis II a Artemis III, které měly s posádkou zamířit k Měsíci, respektive na něm poprvé od konce programu Apollo v roce 1972 přistát. Oznámil to šéf úřadu Bill Nelson.	 Americký Národní úřad pro letectví a vesmír (NASA) o rok odložil mise Artemis II a Artemis III, které měly s posádkou zamířit k Měsíci, respektive na něm poprvé od konce programu Apollo v roce 1972 přistát. Oznámil to šéf úřadu Bill Nelson. Mise Artemis II měla na konci letošního roku s posádkou kopírovat trajektorii Artemis I, která v prosinci 2022 Měsíc obletěla. V rámci mise Artemis III měli na Měsíci přistát dva astronauti. „Upravujeme náš harmonogram, přičemž Artemis II plánujeme uskutečnit v září 2025 a Artemis III v září 2026,“ sdělil Nelson. Oznámení NASA učinila sotva hodinu poté, co soukromá společnost z Pittsburghu Astrobotic Technology (AT) upustila od vlastního pokusu dosáhnout Měsíce. Modul bez posádky zaznamenal problémy s únikem paliva a pohonnými systémy, což vyloučilo možnost takzvaného měkkého přistání, které by umožnilo bezpečně vysadit stroj na povrchu. Agentura AP připomněla, že NASA se v rámci programu Artemis spoléhá do značné míry na soukromé společnosti, které jsou zodpovědné za většinu dílčích částí mise, samotná NASA pak vše hlavně koordinuje. Například lunární přistávací modul si úřad objednal u firmy SpaceX, která loni dvakrát provedla testovací let s kosmickou lodí Starship a nosnou raketou Super Heavy, přičemž právě modifikovaná verze Starship má dopravit dva astronauty na povrch Měsíce. Oba testy ale skončily explozí. Představitelka Space X Jessica Jensenová podle agentury Bloomberg oznámila, že společnost plánuje třetí integrovaný testovací let Starship a SuperHeavy už na letošní únor. Další potenciální překážku představuje vývoj skafandrů pro lunární výstup. Obleky připravuje firma Axiom Space. Podle agentury Reuters mezi další důvody odkladu misí patří i problémy s tepelným štítem či elektrickými systémy modulu Orion. NASA má za sebou zatím jen jeden let programu Artemis. Modul Orion v listopadu 2022 odstartoval bez posádky z mysu Canaveral a po necelém měsíci, kdy obletěl kolem Měsíce, dopadl do Tichého oceánu. Stejný typ modulu astronauti využijí i k letu na Měsíc a zpět, přičemž se na lunární orbitě spojí s lodí Starship, která je snese na lunární povrch. Starship bude muset po startu před cestou k Měsíci na oběžné dráze Země doplnit palivo, což SpaceX plánuje provést pomocí orbitálního skladu. Jde o další klíčový prvek programu, který je zatím ve fázi vývoje. Jensenová nicméně odmítla, že by se jednalo o překážku – společnost SpaceX podle ní podobné dokovací operace v kosmu předvedla už se svou kosmickou lodí Crew Dragon. Program Artemis se dlouhodobě potýká s odklady, což jeho náklady zvýšilo o miliardy dolarů. Americká vláda předpokládá, že se do roku 2025 vyšplhají na 93 miliard dolarů (přes dva biliony korun), píše AP. Program Artemis navazuje na slavné mise Apollo ze sedmdesátých let dvacátého století. Tehdy se Spojené státy rozhodly, že dostanou člověka na Měsíc dříve, než to zvládne Sovětský svaz. Autorem nápadu byl prezident J. F. Kennedy, který ho představil veřejnosti roku 1961 ve slavném projevu na Rice University. „Rozhodli jsme se dosáhnout Měsíce. V tomto desetiletí jsme se rozhodli dosáhnout Měsíce a uskutečnit i další věci. Ne proto, že jsou snadné, ale proto, že jsou obtížné. Protože takový cíl poslouží k tomu, aby uspořádal a posoudil naše nejlepší schopnosti a dovednosti, protože takovou výzvu jsme ochotni přijmout, nejsme ochotni ji odkládat a hodláme ji zvládnout,“ pronesl. Myšlenka cesty na Měsíc se ale Kennedymu líbila nejen z důvodů odvety Rusku, ale hodila se mu také politicky, jako jakési nouzové řešení celé řady vnějších i vnitřních problémů, s nimiž se musela jeho administrativa vypořádávat. Kennedy tehdy nesl zodpovědnost za zahraničně politické fiasko v Zátoce sviní a především za nepříliš zvládnuté rozmístění strategických jaderných nosičů v Turecku, na které Rusko později reagovalo pokusem o rozmístění podobných zbraní na Kubě. Napětí tehdy téměř vedlo k vypuknutí třetí světové války. Prezident tak potřeboval nějaký velký a dobře viditelný úspěch, kterým by ukázal, že je dobrým vládcem nejsilnější země světa. Mise Apollo tehdy dostala jméno po řeckém bohu Apollónovi. Vybral ho ředitel oddělení pro vývoj kosmických letů Abe Silverstein, kterému přišlo atraktivní a současně navazovalo tematicky na mise Merkur, jež byly pojmenované po bohu obchodu. Apollón byl bohem lukostřelby, proroctví, poezie a hudby a paradoxně i Slunce. Jméno Artemis bylo zvolené vhodněji, protože šlo o bohyni lovu a Měsíce, jež byla současně sestrou Apollóna. Současná mise Artemis už nevzniká pod takovým politickým tlakem. Rusko po rozpadu Sovětského svazu nedokázalo navázat na jeho úspěchy v dobývání vesmíru. Přestože dlouhou dobu vynášelo (a dones částečně vynáší) do kosmu náklad pro západní partnery, jeho výzkum a inovace oproti jiným vesmírným velmocem zastaraly. Rusko nicméně na konci loňského roku oznámilo, že také ono plánuje v následujícím desetiletí vyslat na Měsíc kosmonauty a do budoucna tam vybudovat vlastní základnu. Moskva se tedy tentokrát ocitla v opačné pozici než v šedesátých letech – nyní se bude ona pokoušet dohnat náskok konkurenční velmoci. Ruský návrh počítá s pilotovanými lety na Měsíc i prvním přistáním ruské posádky na lunárním povrchu v historii. To by se mělo odehrát nejdříve roku 2031, nejpozději pak prý roku 2041. Následovat by údajně měly expedice i geologický průzkum a od roku 2041 i konstrukce základny, která by podle návrhu využívala vodu a kyslík ze zdrojů na Měsíci. Po roce 2050 pak plán avizuje využití lunárních zdrojů k dalšímu objevování vesmíru. Zatím není jasné, nakolik je Rusko připravené návrh své měsíční mise splnit. Moskvu nyní zaměstnává její válečné tažení proti Ukrajině. Ruský vesmírný sektor, který byl dříve pýchou země, se navíc již několik let potýká s problémy, mimo jiné s nedostatkem financí či neúspěchy. Například letos v srpnu ztroskotala první ruská mise na Měsíc po téměř půlstoletí, když se modul Luna-25 na lunární oběžné dráze vymkl kontrole a posléze narazil do měsíčního povrchu. Do konce desetiletí chce astronauty na Měsíc dostat i Čína, která od loňského roku provozuje vlastní vesmírnou stanici na oběžné dráze Země. Pekingu, který vyslal svou první lidskou posádku do vesmíru v roce 2003, se už povedlo přivézt z Měsíce vzorky a přistát s lunárním vozítkem na jeho méně prozkoumané straně. A zájem aktivně projevila i Indie. Ta vyslala svou misi Čandraján-3 vloni v létě. Měla tři hlavní cíle: přistát se sondou bezpečně a hladce na povrchu Měsíce, vyzkoušet možnosti jízdy roverem po Měsíci a provádět experimenty s materiály dostupnými na lunárním povrchu s cílem lépe porozumět složení Měsíce. Všechny se podařilo splnit.	https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/clanek/veda/nasa-odklada-start-misi-artemis-k-mesici-soukromi-dodavatele-nestihaji-344807	24-01-13_21-36-22	['NASA', 'launch', 'moon', 'Artemis', 'delay']	C:\data_steward_course\02_module\2.7\newspapers_raw_data\24-01-13_21-36-22_JLEYSYRKK_newspaper_article.html	
C82OKEDM0	BBC	Sarah Reid	2024-01-10T13:00:00Z	10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024	With huge numbers of travellers now seeking to travel more lightly and mindfully, these destinations are making sustainable travel easier this year.	 Culture Food Discovery Adventure Destinations Collections About us 50 Reasons to Love the World Untold America More Travellers in 2024 don't need convincing that they have an important role to play in addressing the climate crisis. This awareness is reflected in an ever-increasing array of studies finding that more than three-quarters of global travellers want to travel more sustainably over the coming year, and that 90% of consumers look for sustainable options when travelling. With other sustainable tourism studies finding that an intention-behaviour gap remains, destinations investing in sustainability – in the tourism sector and beyond – can help to bridge it. Mindful travel to places recovering from unrest or disaster, meanwhile, can also help to support a more sustainable future for these destinations. From destinations carving out innovative green spaces to places ready to welcome back tourists in the wake of tragedy, here are 10 destinations welcoming sustainable travellers in 2024. 1. Valencia, Spain Each year, the European Green Capital Award is given to a city with an established and ongoing commitment to improve the environment and quality of life for residents and visitors. This year's recipient was Valencia. Currently working towards generating 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025, the Mediterranean city prides itself on its green spaces, with 500 hectares to explore – including a suite of new urban parks such as its Parque Central, which unites neighbourhoods previously divided by a railway that has since been relocated below ground. This city's green spaces also encompass the Huerta – 120 sq km of produce farms that supply local markets and restaurants, thereby reducing the carbon cost of dining out and self-catering. With improved mass transit services and pedestrian spaces making it easier to get around Valencia, the relatively flat city also offers 200km of bike lanes. Visitors can even cycle (or take public transport) to two national parks fringing the city: the bird-filled Parque Natural de l'Albufera, and Turia Natural Park, which is laced with trails and dotted with natural pools. 2. High Atlas Mountains and Marrakesh, Morocco The earthquake that struck central Morocco in September 2023 caused the deaths of more than 2,900 people and the complete or partial destruction of 50,000 homes – most of these near the 6.8-magnitude quake's epicentre in the High Atlas Mountains near Marrakech. Tours are returning to areas less affected by the 2023 earthquake, such as the Ourika Valley (Credit: Eloi_Omella/Getty Images) While Morocco's tourism industry has proven to be resilient in the face of disaster, with record tourism arrivals in 2023, hotels in largely unscathed Marrakech have reported a drop in bookings, while artisans behind the workshops damaged in Marrakech's old medina are still waiting for aid. All of the city's main attractions, including the El Badi and Bahai palaces, Secret Garden and the Saadian Tombs, have reopened since the earthquake, and while some areas of the old medina remain closed, its spice-scented alleys are as atmospheric as ever. Although it's still too early to revisit some parts of the snow-capped High Atlas Mountains as communities rebuild, Abercrombie & Kent is among a raft of tourism operators helping to support the region's recovery by returning to less-affected areas such as the Ourika Valley, a popular trekking destination. Intrepid Travel has launched four new trips to Morocco for 2024, including a venture through the Happy Valley, also known as the Ait Bougmez region of the High Atlas Mountains. 3. Saba, Dutch Caribbean The smallest special municipality of the Netherlands, the tiny tropical island of Saba is emerging as a champion of sustainable tourism in the Caribbean. Balancing the carbon cost of flying to the 13-sq-km island (reached by ferry from neighbouring St Maarten) is an impressive array of initiatives, including a solar park producing 35-40% of the island's power needs, a comprehensive recycling system, a marine park encircling the island (with excellent diving) and a ban on single-use plastics (Saba has its own water bottling plant). Helping to reduce dependence on the island's precious resources is a hydroponics farm at Rendezvous restaurant in the town of Windwardside, which uses 80% less water than conventional farming methods. In 2023, the Saba Bank – the largest submarine atoll in the Atlantic Ocean – was named by international marine conservation organisation Mission Blue as a Hope Spot, a designation identifying destinations scientifically identified as critical to the ocean's health. Saba is also home to the first marine lab in the Windward Islands of the Dutch Caribbean for applied research, while the longstanding Sea & Learn Foundation engages travellers and locals in environmental projects throughout the year, from identifying fluorescing scorpions on a night hike to measuring growth rates of endemic orchids. The mountainous volcanic island is laced with lush hiking trails, while beautifully patterned Nassau groupers are among the abundance of reef fish commonly encountered by snorkellers and scuba divers. Birders are in for a treat, with the entire coastline identified by Birdlife International as an Important Birding Area. The Southern Ridges trail is one of the best spots in Singapore to enjoy views of the city, harbour and the Southern Islands (Tuul & Bruno Morandi/Getty Images) 4. Singapore Singapore's sustainability journey is legendary, kicking off in 1967 when then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew mooted his "city in a garden" vision. Following more than 50 years of mindful urban development – including the creation of more than 300km of green corridors as part of the city-state's Park Connector Network – Singapore became the world's first entire nation to receive sustainable destination certification from the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, in 2023. The certification reflects the Southeast Asian nation's commitment to its Singapore Green Plan 2030 goals for sustainable development, which includes quadrupling solar energy deployment by 2025, reducing the waste sent to landfill by 20% by 2030, and limiting the registration of new cars to cleaner-energy models from 2030. Locals and visitors continue to reap the benefits, with new and upcoming attractions including the 24km hiking-biking Rail Corridor (due to fully open in 2024) and the enhancement of 13 southern parks, along with two new trails on the Coast to Coast Trail network. Singapore is also set to welcome seven new MRT (metro) stations on the Thomson-East Coast Line in early 2024. Opened in 2023 with cutting-edge initiatives (including a biodigester that transforms food waste into cleaning water), the Green Mark Platinum-certified Pan Pacific Orchard joins the Parkroyal Collection Pickering, a "hotel in a garden", as an innovative low-impact accommodation option for visitors. 5. Belfast, UK The UK's tourism industry remains the strongest supporter of the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism launched at COP25 in 2021, with 172 signatories compared to the US in second place with 73. Among the UK cities making the biggest strides towards a sustainable future is Belfast, which in 2023 jumped from 47th place in the Global Destination Sustainability Index into the top 11 within 18 months. The Northern Ireland capital is now being held up as a blueprint for excellence in a white paper published by Edinburgh-based sustainability certification organisation Green Tourism. Since the 2021 launch of its Belfast Resilience Goal targeting an inclusive, zero-emissions, climate-resilient economy within a generation, the city has seen more than 90 hotels, attractions and restaurants committed to sustainable tourism through Visit Belfast's internationally recognised Green Tourism program (up from five in 2021), with 75% of Belfast hotel rooms now holding a sustainability certification (up from 25% in 2021). Popular Green Tourism-certified attractions include the Titanic Belfast museum, which aims to be a zero-waste organisation by 2030, and the neighbouring Titanic Hotel Belfast, created in the former headquarters of Harland and Wolff, builders of the RMS Titanic. With more than 50 docking stations, Belfast Bikes offers an easy, green local transport option. Few visitors make it to the Southern Great Barrier Reef, but those who do are rewarded with beautiful islands like Lady Musgrave (Credit: Rani Zerafa/Getty Images) 6. Southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia Approximately 90% of the two million annual visitors to the Great Barrier Reef stick to the sultry northern hubs of Cairns and Townsville. Yet, some of the most rewarding and low-impact opportunities to experience this 2,300-km-long ecosystem occur in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. Rehabilitated from a guano-mined coral cay left to feral goats, the manta ray haven of Lady Elliot Island at the reef's southern tip is now one of Australia's foremost eco-resorts, run almost entirely on renewable energy. Just 40km to north-east as the crow flies, uninhabited Lady Musgrave Island provides a wild backdrop for day trips and overnight glamping experiences with Lady Musgrave Experience, which holds Advance Ecotourism and Climate Action certifications from Ecotourism Australia. Tours operate from the region's key mainland port of Bundaberg, which received sustainable destination certification in 2023, also from Ecotourism Australia. Its state-of-the-art Mon Repos turtle education centre runs ranger-led turtle viewing tours during the nesting and hatching season (November to March), while recently launched Taribelang Bunda Tours offers opportunities to connect with ancient sustainability practices on Indigenous-guided experiences. The relaxed agricultural region also offers a smorgasbord of farmgate and cellar door experiences including the Bundaberg Rum Visitor Experience, which in 2023 became the first tourism operator in Australia to achieve Ecotourism Australia's new Sustainable Tourism Certification. 7. Panama, Central America Costa Rica has carved out a reputation as Central America's leader in sustainable tourism, and now neighbouring Panama – which in 2023 granted legal rights to turtles – is stepping into the limelight as a community-based tourism pioneer. Despite Panama's diverse array of Indigenous cultures (accounting for approximately 14% of the population) and rich biodiversity, the nation's tourism has traditionally centred on its famed canal and sultry capital Panama City. Now, visitors can explore Panama's lush rainforests and palm-fringed islands more meaningfully with the people who know it best: Indigenous and rural communities. The recently launched SOSTUR digital portal lets visitors book local-guided adventures in regions largely untouched by tourism, from visiting the Naso (also known as Teribe) communities who have lived in the jungles of north-western Panama since before Spanish colonists arrived, to learning about the legends of the warriors and guardians of Dekö island from an Indigenous Ngöbe guide. A new portal is enabling visitors to explore Panama's lush rainforests and palm-fringed islands more meaningfully (Credit: Andrea Comi/Getty Images) The portal is part of the Panamanian government's US$301m Sustainable Tourism Development Master Plan, which runs through 2025. It's main goal? To grow visitor numbers in a way that prioritises people and nature. 8. Maui, United States The horror of the wildfires that ravaged the Hawaiian island of Maui in August 2023, claiming at least 115 lives, destroying more than 2,200 buildings and homes and uprooting thousands, was felt around the world. In the days following the tragedy, many Hawaiians told tourists to stay away. But with restaurants, hotels and tour operators since forced to lay off workers and unemployment rates surging, officials are now asking people to return responsibly. Given the extensive devastation on the north-western side of the island, the Hawai'i Tourism Authority (HTA) reports that Lāhainā will remain closed to the public until further notice, and recommends checking accommodations in the nearby communities of Kā'anapali, Nāpili and Kapalua for availability before visiting. The island's wilder east side, meanwhile, remains ripe for exploration. Embark on the Road to Hana, a 103km road trip that takes in a sublime stretch of coastline fringed by wild beaches, picturesque waterfalls and lush trails; bring a torch for a self-guided tour of the Hana Lava Tubes near road Marker 31. Near Hana, explore the "alien" forest of Hosmer Grove in in Haleakalā National Park. Travellers can search for local businesses to support on the Maui Nui First website. 9. Greenland Long overshadowed by the ground-breaking sustainable tourism initiatives of the lower Nordic nations, Greenland is increasingly also taking steps to safeguard its icy territory – and its growing tourism industry – as it navigates its future on the frontline of the climate crisis. Nuuk became the world's first capital city to be certified by EarthCheck as a sustainable tourist destination in 2020. In 2022, Visit Greenland announced the cessation of its support for conventional cruise tourism on sustainability grounds, and in 2023, Visit Greenland invited the tourism industry to support a shared pledge towards more sustainable and responsible tourism development. As the nation prepares to welcome a new international airport in Nuuk in 2024, operators are urged to support the pledge's five themes, spanning the support of local products to creating unique opportunities for tourists to visit throughout the seasons. Illulissat's new visitor centre and airport will encourage tourists to venture beyond Greenland's capital (Credit: Eloi_Omella/Getty Images) After banning future oil and gas exploration in 2021, Greenland is now focused on rolling out renewable energy, with government-run energy company Nukissiorfiit working towards producing 100% green energy by 2030. Expected to save 127 tonnes of CO2, the churches of Nuuk will be powered by green energy in 2024. Encouraging tourism beyond the capital is the excellent Icefjord Centre in Illulissat, due to welcome a new airport of its own in the coming years. Supporting sustainable local industries can also have a big impact in this island nation: try a musk ox burger, and look for the "Authentic Nunavut" sticker certifying Nunavut Inuit-made crafts. 10. Dominica, Lesser Antillies In the wake of the category-five hurricane that devastated the small Caribbean island nation in 2017, Dominica's prime minister announced plans to make Dominica "the world's first climate-resilient nation". While the development of early-warning systems and resilient housing is now helping to safeguard residents, a new kayaking trail is helping to promote the island – already home to the Caribbean's longest hiking trail – as a sustainable tourism destination. Hugging the island's dramatic west coast for more than 60km, the Waitukubuli Sea Trail is the Caribbean's first dedicated sea kayaking route. It runs south to north along the island's western coastline, taking in welcoming communities, secluded beaches, dramatic scenery and local cuisine. The trail is the brainchild of long-time Caribbean Peace Corps worker Wes Moses, who opened Soufriere Outdoor Centre on the island's south-west coast in 2022 after settling in Dominica in 2018. He's also joined forces with coastal lodgings to create a network of accommodations along the trail's 14 sections, with land-based hiking excursions and cultural experiences to enjoy along the way. Not far from the trailhead at Scott's Head, Coulibri Ridge, the island's newest eco-resort, offers a luxurious base to kick-start your kayaking adventure.

ZZHQ1DQU2	CNN	['Lauren del Valle', 'Kristen Holmes', 'Katelyn  Polantz', 'Kaitlan Collins', 'Kara Scannell']	2024-01-10T16:30:43.444Z	Trump can’t speak during closing arguments in NY civil fraud trial, judge says	Judge Arthur Engoron said Wednesday he does not expect Donald Trump to speak during closing arguments in the New York civil fraud trial against Trump.	Judge Arthur Engoron said Wednesday he does not expect Donald Trump to speak during closing arguments in the $370 million New York civil fraud trial against Trump. In a letter to attorneys for Trump and New York Attorney General Letitia James just after noon Wednesday, Engoron said that Trump hasn’t agreed to conditions he set should the former president wish to give a statement. “Not having heard from you by the third extended deadline (noon today), I assume that Mr. Trump will not agree to the reasonable, lawful limits I have imposed as a precondition to giving a closing statement above and beyond those given by his attorneys, and that, therefore, he will not be speaking in court tomorrow,” Engoron wrote. Email correspondence shows the parties have been discussing the possibility of Trump participating in the closing arguments since at least last week. Trump and his team have used his court appearances to claim election interference by Joe Biden, paint his legal woes as political persecution, and draw media attention away from his Republican rivals who have struggled to chip away at his significant lead in the polls. Trump is not facing criminal charges in the civil fraud case, but the claims against the former president hit him personally, as the New York attorney general is seeking $370 million in damages and to bar Trump from doing business in the state. The New York attorney general alleges that Trump, his two adult sons and his company defrauded banks and insurance companies by inflating the value of the former president’s assets in order to obtain more favorable rates. Engoron has already ruled that Trump was liable for fraud; the judge is now considering damages and six additional claims in the bench trial. The attorney general’s office opposed Trump’s plan to speak during the defense closing argument but also acknowledged it was up to the judge’s discretion. “Allowing Mr. Trump to present closing argument will invite more speeches that will ‘unduly disrupt’ the proceedings,” Andrew Amer wrote in an email last Thursday. Takeaways from the appeals court hearing on Donald Trump’s immunity claims CNN reporter describes Trump’s demeanor during his presidential immunity hearing Trump has clashed repeatedly with Engoron throughout the 11-week trial. The judge put a gag order in place barring comments about his staff the opening week of the trial after Trump posted attacks on social media about the judge’s clerk. Engoron fined Trump twice for violating the gag order – including hauling him onto the witness stand to answer questions about comments he made outside the courtroom when he complained about the “a person who is very partisan sitting alongside” the judge. Engoron offered Trump the opportunity to speak in his own defense closing argument but said the former president must agree to preset conditions that would limit what he can and cannot say. He would not be allowed to campaign, the judge said. Engoron also said if Trump violated the gag order, he’d fine him and remove him from court. “Thus, in my sole discretion, I will consent to let Mr. Trump make a closing argument if, and only if, through counsel by 1/9/2024, and by himself, personally, on the record, just before he speaks, he agrees to limit his subjects to what is permissible in a counsel’s closing argument, that is, commentary on the relevant, material facts that are in evidence, and application of the relevant law to those facts,” Engoron wrote in an email last week. “He may not seek to introduce new evidence. He may not ‘testify.’ He may not comment on irrelevant matters,” Engoron wrote. “In particular, and without limitation, he may not deliver a campaign speech, and he may not impugn myself, my staff, plaintiff, plaintiff’s staff, or the New York State Court System, none of which is relevant to this case, and all of which, except commenting on my staff, can be done, and is being done, in other forums.” Trump’s attorney Chris Kise said Trump would not agree to such terms and went back and forth with Engoron minutes before the deadline, email records show. “He cannot agree (nor would i recommend he do so) to the proposed preconditions and prior restraints,” Kise wrote in an email response. Engoron pushed back in a subsequent email Tuesday, writing, “Your and your client’s rejection of the reasonable, normal limits I am imposing on any argument by Mr. Trump, which are the same limits that the law imposes on any person making a closing argument, completely justifies the need to impose them.” Engoron extended the deadline to agree to the terms more than once and gave Trump’s team a final chance just before noon Wednesday. “I won’t debate this yet again. Take it or leave it. Now or never. You have until noon, seven minutes from now. I WILL NOT GRANT ANY FURTHER EXTENSIONS,” Engoron wrote to Kise. The closing arguments are coming two days after Trump’s lackluster appearance in a Washington, DC, courtroom yielded less fanfare than the former president has grown accustomed to while dropping in and out of the courthouse in New York. Trump’s advisers had warned him that the federal courthouse would not give him an opportunity to seize the spotlight. He stayed at his private club in Virginia, traveled by motorcade to Washington, where there was no aerial coverage because of flight restrictions in the nation’s capital, drove into a garage and entered the courtroom with no cameras or microphones. Trump appeared on Tuesday at the US Court of Appeals for oral arguments over his presidential immunity claims. While Trump can choose to attend the proceedings, his appearance also was meant to be a distraction from his GOP rivals six days ahead of the Iowa caucuses. While Trump insisted on attending the hearing, he decided to hold a last-minute press event afterward, causing US Secret Service and his team to scramble for him to deliver remarks at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. “It’s not like we want him to be going to court. We didn’t ask for that. But we’re playing the hand we’ve been dealt,” one senior adviser told CNN. Last month, Trump and his lawyers insisted that Trump would be called to testify as the final witness in the New York civil fraud case, only to reverse course. And last spring, Trump told reporters in Ireland that he was leaving his trip and would “probably attend” the civil trial over E. Jean Carroll’s rape allegation in New York to “confront” the allegations. He did not attend. Meanwhile, Engoron has denied a coalition of media organization’s request to televise the closing arguments. In an order emailed to the parties Wednesday, Engoron wrote, “I hereby deny your application to stream the proceedings live. Although I (and I hope others) consider myself a strong believer in press access and a transparency, this particular case has, as I’m sure you are aware, presented very serious safety issues.” Cameras will still be allowed to take video and photos of Trump and the attorneys before closing arguments begin. They will also still be permitted in the hallways where Trump frequently addresses the media to criticize the judge, the New York attorney general and President Joe Biden.

Scientists found that the children living in places with 20-25% more natural areas had increased bone strength that was equivalent to half a year’s natural growth. The study, the first of its kind, also found that the risk of having very low bone density was about 65% lower for these children. Bone strength grows in childhood and adolescence, before plateauing until about the age of 50 and then declining. Increasing the size and accessibility of green spaces for children could therefore prevent fractures and osteoporosis in older people, the researchers said. The link between green spaces and stronger bones is likely to result from higher levels of physical activity in children who live near parks, as this spurs bone growth. The connection was strongest for green spaces with trees, which the scientists said may be because these were more attractive places to visit. “The stronger the bone mass is during childhood, the more capacity you have for later in life,” said Prof Tim Nawrot, at Hasselt University in Belgium, who was part of the study team with Dr Hanne Sleurs and others. “So the real public health message from this study is that urban planners can make stronger bones of children, and that has long-lasting consequences.” Previous research has found greater access to green spaces increases physical activity in children. Studies have also discovered multiple benefits for child development, including a lower risk of being overweight, lower blood pressure, higher IQs and better mental and emotional wellbeing. Green spaces are also linked to better physical and mental health in adults. Woodland walks are estimated to save £185m a year in mental health costs in the UK. The study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, followed more than 300 children in a region of Flanders, Belgium, that included urban, suburban and rural areas. Scientist used ultrasound to measure the bone density of the children at ages from four to six years old. The child’s age, weight, height, ethnicity and their mother’s level of education were taken into account. The results showed, for example, that children with 25% more green space within 1,000 metres of their home had a 66% lower risk of having very low bone density, ie of being in the lowest 10% of measurements. No difference was found between the boys and the girls in the study. The researchers said the results were important as low bone growth at a young age was as crucial to the onset of osteoporosis as bone loss through ageing. Screen time, vitamin supplements and daily consumption of dairy products were also tested to see if they affected the children’s results but no significant impacts were found. The study showed a strong association between nearby green space and bone strength in children but was not set up to show a causal link. To do that, children would need to wear accelerometers to record their physical activity. “That would not be a very easy experiment to do,” Nawrot said. Two recent studies on bone density in adults and green spaces produced conflicting results. An analysis of 66,000 people in south-west China found a significant positive link. But research on 4,000 people aged 65 and older in Hong Kong did not find a convincing association, possibly because Hong Kong is a very densely populated city with little green space.	https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/13/children-living-near-green-spaces-tronger-bones-study	24-01-13_21-39-26	['health', 'children', 'nature', 'growth']	C:\data_steward_course\02_module\2.7\newspapers_raw_data\24-01-13_21-39-26_3OC5CRDRL_newspaper_article.html

By Harold Thibault (Keelung, Taiwan, special correspondent) Time to  7 min. Subscribers only Television and bus advertisements for political parties, large posters of candidates on building walls and vans weaving through cities broadcasting their names via loudspeakers: the campaign is in full swing in Taiwan, in the run-up to the presidential and parliamentary elections on Saturday, January 13. At a rally held a few days before the vote in the central square opposite the port of Keelung, in the north of the island, thousands of people waved the green flags of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The cheers and shouts intensified when President Tsai Ing-wen, who is nearing the end of her second and final term, appeared on stage, accompanied by the candidate poised to succeed her, the current Vice-President, Lai Ching-te. The son of a miner who died when he was still a baby, Lai became a doctor after studying at Taiwan's most prestigious university and at Harvard in the United States. He then changed careers, becoming a politician when Chinese missiles were flying over the island during the first democratic presidential election in 1996. Successively member of parliament, mayor of Tainan, the large southern city, prime minister and unsuccessful candidate in the DPP primary against Tsai in 2020, before settling for the vice presidency, the seasoned politician is biding his time. He toured the island seven times during the campaign, leaving no stone unturned and appearing perfectly groomed at every appearance. At each rally, voters raised economic and social issues. These include housing prices and salaries, which have not kept pace with the rising cost of living (except in the semiconductor sector, the pride of the country) and aid to encourage couples to have children, at a time when the birth rate is falling steadily. But the issue that deeply divides the political class is the attitude to adopt towards China. "We must continue on the road to democracy, and to do so, we must choose the right person," said Lai, 64, his "Team Taiwan" baseball jacket slung over his back. A few dozen meters away, on the railway platform, Fan Li-ti listened with a curious ear. This 37-year-old woman clad in jeans and checkered Vans sneakers isn't an activist − she had just got off the train that brings her back from Taipei every evening, where she works in tech. "If we can do business with China, fine, but we mustn't give up our rights," said Fan, who plans to vote for the DPP but without great conviction. Like her, many people are worried that fostering too close of a relationship with China could lead to Taiwan being swallowed up politically and economically. Many also fear military reprisals in the event of a head-on challenge. You have 75% of this article left to read. The rest is for subscribers only. Lecture du Monde en cours sur un autre appareil.
